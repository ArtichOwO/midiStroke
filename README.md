While some users have reported success with Catalina, I'm avoiding upgrading from Mojave at all costs and have no way of debugging in Catalina currently. I'm also in the slow process of moving to Linux (partially thanks to my 2018 MBP easily being the worst computer I've ever owned)... somone else should really take this project over.
